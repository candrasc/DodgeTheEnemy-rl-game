# rl_game_dodge_the_enemy
Created a game to teach a reinforcement learning agent to play it. The game can be rendered and played with pygame.

The RL agent can succesfully win the game, gifs and examples will be coming soon.

## Game Objectives:
1) Collect all the rewards (multi-color bouncing squares)
2) Dodge the enemies (red bouncing squares)

## See it in action! ##
1) Clone the repo
2) Edit the game config to have your desired params such as range of: enemy velocities, num enemies, enemy size (and the same for rewards to collect)
3) Run "main_rl.py" from the console and you can watch the AI play the game!
4) To restart the game in the same environment, double tap "space". To restart in a new random environment, double tap "q"

If you want to play the game yourself, just run "main.py"
